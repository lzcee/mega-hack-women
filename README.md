# Mega Hack Women: "empreenDelas" plataform
Project developed for the Mega Hack Women marathon, a hackathon dedicated only to women, which took place between 30 August and 7 September 2020.
## Description
For the development of a mobile platform with the objective of high performance and scalability, aligned with the indispensable good navigation experience for users, React was used in addiction to the React Router library. To request the data, the Axios library was used from an API built on the REST model that can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/aliciadias/mega-hack-women-backend).

The visual of this platform was made from the mockups that can be found on this [link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/9e80e638-d862-4dc5-a72c-2c12baaf8c54-cbd3/flow/).
